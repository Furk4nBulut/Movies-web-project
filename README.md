# Movies Web Project

## Overview

The Movies Web Project is a web application developed using Django. This project serves as a practical demonstration of my learning journey with Django, focusing on building a dynamic and interactive movie catalog.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python (3.x)
- Django (3.x or later)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movies-web-project.git
   cd movies-web-project
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Apply Migrations**

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Run the Development Server**

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   You can now access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
